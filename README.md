## Aris-Edryna-The-Great-War-Of-Orcs
My final project as a part of the course: https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/
It is a game developed using the pygame module for the GUI

In the game, you play as Aris Edryna, the warrior princess of the Kingdom of Northwind. The Orc scum from the distant lands of 
Throl'dados are marching towards your kingdom in great numbers. They plunder villages and set fire to towns on their way, 
leaving behind a trail of dark ashes. All seems lost, till an Orc messenger carries word to the kingdom.

>"I seek to meet my match on the battle-ground. Meet me, Lady Edryna at the forest of the whispering willows. We shall have a battle
that will decide the destiny of your kingdom. Defeat me and thou kingdom shall be saved." 
-Usu'ruz Angerscream, King of the Orcs

Play as Aris Edryna, the warrior of light, and save your kingdom from obscurity.
